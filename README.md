# PythonPrograms
This contains all of the programs I've written for the Python Programming class I took at De Anza College. These are all my original work and I've also included descriptions of the problems below. 
___________________________________
## Unit A
### Exercise A
In this exercise, you will write some simple code.
Look at lab instructions and use the Wing Interactive Develoment Environment.
1) Create rectangle height and width variables and initialize them with the values 2.9 and 7.1 respectively.
2) Calculate the area of the rectangle and save it in an area variable.
3) Print the height, width, and area of the rectangle as shown below.
Note: Use the sample code shown below to print - we will learn more about printing in the next Unit.
print("Height:", height)
4) Use floor division to modify the values in the height and width variables by dividing them by 2.
Note: floor division is the prefered name in Python. Elsewhere it is commonly called integer division.
5) Print the data for this smaller rectangle.
Did you get the answers you expected?

### Problem A
**Basic numeric operations**
1) Calculate and print the final value of each variable.
- a equals 3 to the power of 2.5
- b equals 2
- b equals b + 3 (use +=)
- c equals 12
- c = c divided by 4 (use /=)
- d equals the remainder of 5 divided by 3
**Built-in functions abs, round, and min**
2) Use abs, round, and min to calculate some values. These are all Python built in functions (see: BIF).
- Print the absolute difference between 5 and 7 (the answer should always be a positive number).
- Print 3.14159 rounded to 4 decimal places.
- Print 186282 rounded to the nearest hundred.
- Print the minimum of 6, -9, -3, 0
**Functions from the math module**
3) Use some functions from Pythons math module to perform some calculations. (see: Mathematical functions).
- Ask the user for a number (test with the value 7.6).
- Print the square root of the number, rounded to two decimal places (include an appropriate description).
- Print the base-10 log of the number, rounded to two decimal places (include an appropriate description)

## Unit B
### Exercise B
1) String methods
- Ask the user for a name (test with George Washington).
- Print the name in all uppercase letters.
- Print the length of the name.
- Print the 4th character of the name (r).
- Create a variable called name2. Assign to name2 the name with all "o" characters replaced with "x"s.
- Print name2.
- Print the original name.
2) Counting and Finding
- Assign the text "Believe you can and you're halfway there." to a variable called quote (this is a quote from Theodore Roosevelt).
- Count how many "a" characters there are, print the result.
- Print the index of all the "a" characters.
- Hint: Except for the first find, set the start location for the next find as the previous location found index + 1. The second argument in the find method is the index where the find starts looking.
